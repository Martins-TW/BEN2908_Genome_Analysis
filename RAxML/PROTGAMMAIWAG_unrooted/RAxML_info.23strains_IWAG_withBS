You are using a proportion of Invariable sites estimate, although I don't
like it. The likelihood epsilon "-f e" will be automatically lowered to 0.001
to avoid unfavorable effects caused by simultaneous optimization of alpha and P-Invar


WARNING: RAxML is not checking sequences for duplicate seqs and sites with missing data!

RAxML Bipartition Computation: Drawing support values from trees in file RAxML_bootstrap.IWAG_bootstrap onto tree in file RAxML_bestTree.IWAG_tree_run


RAxML was called as follows:

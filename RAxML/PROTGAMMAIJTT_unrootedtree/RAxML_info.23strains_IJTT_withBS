You are using a proportion of Invariable sites estimate, although I don't
like it. The likelihood epsilon "-f e" will be automatically lowered to 0.001
to avoid unfavorable effects caused by simultaneous optimization of alpha and P-Invar


WARNING: RAxML is not checking sequences for duplicate seqs and sites with missing data!

RAxML Bipartition Computation: Drawing support values from trees in file RAxML_bootstrap.IJTT_bootstrap onto tree in file RAxML_bestTree.IJTT_tree_run


RAxML was called as follows:

/usr/bin/raxmlHPC-PTHREADS-AVX -T 4 -f b -t RAxML_bestTree.IJTT_tree_run -z RAxML_bootstrap.IJTT_bootstrap -m PROTGAMMAIJTT -n 23strains_IJTT_withBS 




Found 1 tree in File RAxML_bestTree.IJTT_tree_run



Found 1000 trees in File RAxML_bootstrap.IJTT_bootstrap
